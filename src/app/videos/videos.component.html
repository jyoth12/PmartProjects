                    For "PMart Enterprises," if this is a specific company or brand, you might want to provide more context 
                    or details about their product line or specialization in furniture to give a more precise definition tailored to their offerings. If you have specific requirements or
                     characteristics associated with PMart Enterprises furniture, such as design styles, materials used, 
                     or unique features, sharing those details would help in crafting a more accurate definition.

                    The mobile phone can be used to communicate over long distances without wires.
                     It works by communicating with a nearby base station (also called a "mobile tower") which connects it to the main phone network.
                      When moving, if the mobile phone gets too far away from the cell it is connected to, that cell sends a message to another cell to tell the new cell to take over the call.
